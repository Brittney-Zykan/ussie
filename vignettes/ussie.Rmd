ussie let's you work with european soccer data from the engsoccerdata package
by making standard tibbles for each country

```{r matches_italy}
matches_italy <- uss_make_matches(engsoccerdata::italy, "Italy")
glimpse(matches_italy)
```

you can even filter

```{r matches_1929}
# matches_1929 <- uss_make_matches("italy", season == 1929) |>
# glimpse(matches_1929)
```

we can accumulate seasons

```{r}
# italy <- uss_get_matches("italy") %>%  uss_make_teams_matches()
# 
```
